# Steamboat Table

Steamboat Table is a plugin that was created due to experiencing the limitations of Bootstrap Vue's table, among others.
The main features of Steamboat Table that set it apart are:
* Dependency Free
* Does not reset state on filter or pagination as long as the selected row stays within the result set
* Use slots to customize how columns are rendered
* Display a subset of all columns
* And more.
